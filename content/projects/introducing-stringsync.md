##### What is StringSync?

[stringsync.com](https://www.stringsync.com) is a progressive web app (PWA) that helps people learn guitar with one simple goal in mind:

>if you can hear it, then you can play it

##### The problem

There are people that want to learn how to play music quickly. Of these people, there is a small subset of people that have the time, money, and willingness to pursue the tried-and-true traditional guitar learning methods.

Unfortunately, these methods often fail to balance music theory and application in a manner that is consistently rewarding.

Music theory is simply the study of the theoretical elements of music. It is not required to play music well. It is unnecessary overhead to students that *just want to play music*.

##### Plain tabs are not the answer

Providing plain tablature is the philosophical equivalent of giving a man a fish to eat for a day. On the other hand, StringSync is teaching that man how to fish. By synchronizing tablature with audio and video, students will naturally rely on their instincts:

>if it sounds good, then it **is** good

##### Leveraging technology

Synchronizing video, audio, and tablature is not a new teaching strategy. However, this has been usually accomplished through a static video asset. While effective to some degree, this only allows one way of communication.

With user interface (UI) libraries such as React, it is possible to create a rich and **interactive** guitar learning experience... in a web browser! Accessibility is reduced to having a device that has a modern web browser.

##### The future of StringSync

StringSync's short term goal is to provide simple visual abstractions of music. For example, the virtual fretboard supplements tablature with a more intuitive and familiar interface.

I'll write about the interesting aspects of StringSync as they come.
